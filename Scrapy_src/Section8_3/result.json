In an interview with Russian YouTube channel\u00a0, Intel\u2019s chief architect and graphics head Raja\u00a0Koduri\u00a0said that the chip giant is targeting the mainstream $200 price point with its initial consumer offering.Koduri\u00a0drops the information around the 6:15 mark in the video below. If you don\u2019t speak Russian, you can turn on closed captioning and set the subtitles to English in the video settings, but they\u2019re a bit garbled. Fortunately,\u00a0Redditor u/taryakun\u00a0provided a more legible translation of the exchange:\u00a0AMD has also taken the \u201cGPUs for everyone\u201d approach in recent years, kicking off recent GPU generations with more affordable options, including the $200 Radeon RX 480 and $350 Radeon RX 5700. Raja\u00a0Koduri\u00a0headed AMD\u2019s Radeon division before\u00a0. Nvidia, meanwhile, tends to launch new GPU generations with powerful high-end graphics cards like the $600 GeForce GTX 1080 and $1,200 RTX 2080\u00a0Ti. Nvidia has dominated enthusiast-class graphics cards for several years now, which probably plays into it and AMD\u2019s respective release strategies.If Intel aims for the mainstream \u201csweet spot\u201d of graphics card pricing, the company could build on the back of its existing graphics empire. The company is already the volume leader in PC graphics thanks to the integrated graphics built into most of its processors, and the  that launched yesterday pack vastly improved visual capabilities.One thing you\u00a0\u00a0want to read too much into:\u00a0Koduri's\u00a0mentioning HBM for data center variations of\u00a0Xe\u00a0in the same breath as the $200 price point. High-bandwidth memory has its place in the world, but we\u2019d be shocked to see the expensive technology trickle down into $200 consumer graphics cards by 2020.AMD\u2019s $400-plus Radeon Vega GPUs came equipped with HBM2, but\u00a0\u00a0shifted back to traditional GDDR6 memory. In\u00a0, Radeon chief Scott\u00a0Herkelman\u00a0confirmed that the price of HBM was a big part of that decision.\u00a0\u00a0This story, \"News that Intel's first Xe graphics cards will cost $200 turns out to be a mistranslation\" was originally published by \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n."},

Meanwhile, Windows 7's portion of only those PCs running Windows also plummeted, falling to 36%, a number not seen since late 2011 when the operating system was barely two years old and busily nibbling away at Windows XP.(The second number is larger than the first because Windows does not power every PC; in July, Windows ran 88.5% of the world's machines. All but a tiny fraction of the rest ran macOS, Linux or Chrome OS.)At the same time, Windows 10's share jumped by 3.1 percentage points to 48.9% of all personal computers and 55.2% of those running Windows. The monthly increase was the second-largest ever for Windows 10 (first place went to March 2019), while both percentages were records for the OS.So, did millions suddenly drop Windows 7 and switch to Windows 10? (Net Applications' data and 's calculations pegged the leaving-Windows-7 number at 61 million, the moving-to-Windows-10 number at 51 million.) Unclear. The change rate wasn't implausible - other measurements have gone up, or down, just as dramatically and been proven to be accurate if not exact - and the time before Windows 7 falls off the support list  very short.Last month,  highlighted the quickening of Windows 10 growth by showing the difference between the 6- and 12-month averages. The sudden addition of another 3+ points in July only skewed the numbers further toward that acceleration. Also telling are the new forecasts that July's Windows 10 upswing - and Windows 7's downturn - generated.Windows 7's future - based, as always, on the operating system's 12-month average change - must now be more palatable to Microsoft, which earlier had to have been concerned about the operating system's stubbornness. 's latest calculation says that in January 2020, when Windows 7 exits support, its user share should stand at 30.7%, a whole five points lower than our prognostication of the month before. That's a lot fewer PCs stranded without security updates.Meanwhile, Windows 10 should account for approximately 62% of all Windows installations when the older OS drops off support, an increase of four points from the month-ago forecast. A year later - January 2021 - Windows 7 and Windows 10 will be at 20% and 76%, respectively.Of special note is that the 30.7% currently forecast as Windows 7's user share at support expiration is very close to the 29% of all Windows PCs running Windows XP five years ago when  left support. For the last two years, the comparison between Windows XP's actual vanishing act and Windows 7's predicted performance always put the latter in the worst light; the data proclaimed that users were reluctant to give up Windows 7.Not in July. In July, millions apparently didn't need anyone to pry the 10-year-old OS from their cold hands. They gave it up without a fight."},

Now what?", "img_url": "https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/09/siri-icon-apple-website-100773330-large.jpg", "contents": "A week after a  revealed that humans in Apple\u2019s Siri \u201cgrading\u201d program were hearing private and illegal activity, Apple  to conduct a review. It\u2019s also working on a software update to give users the ability to opt-out (or maybe opt-in).Apple issued a simple statement: \u201cWe are committed to delivering a great Siri experience while protecting user privacy. While we conduct a thorough review, we are suspending Siri grading globally. Additionally, as part of a future software update, users will have the ability to choose to participate in grading.\u201dThat\u2019s the right thing to do, but it makes me wonder what the path forward is supposed to be. Because, while most people don\u2019t realize it, machine learning (ML) and AI is built on a foundation of human \u201cgrading\u201d and there\u2019s no good alternative in sight. And with Siri frequently criticized for being a year or two behind its rivals, it\u2019s not going to be easy for Apple to catch up while protecting our privacy.What\u2019s this Siri grading program all about? Basically, every time you say \u201cHey Siri...\u201d the command you utter gets processed on your device but  semi-anonymized and sent up to the cloud. Some small percentage of these are used to help train the neural network that allows Siri (and Apple\u2019s Dictation feature) to accurately understand what you\u2019re saying. Somebody, somewhere in the world, is listening to some of the \u201cHey Siri\u201d commands and making a note of whether Siri understood the person correctly or not.Then the machine-learning network is adjusted, and re-adjusted, and re-adjusted, through millions of permutations. The changes are automatically tested against these \u201cgraded\u201d samples until a new ML algorithm produces more accurate results. Then \u00a0neural network becomes the new baseline, and the process repeats.There\u2019s just no way to train ML algorithms\u2014for speech recognition or photos recognition or determining whether your security camera saw a person or a car\u2014without a human training it in this way. If there was a computer algorithm that could always accurately determine whether the AI was right or wrong, it would  the AI algorithm!Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and anyone else producing AI assistants using machine-learning algorithms to recognize speech or detect objects in photos or video or almost anything else are doing this. They\u2019re listening in on your assistant queries, they\u2019re looking at your photos, they\u2019re watching your security cameras.Sort of.(In fact, Google has also  of its language recordings after a German investigation revealed that contractors leaked confidential info to the press. Oops.)You can certainly train ML algorithms using a bunch of commercially-purchased and licensed photos, videos, and voice samples. And many companies do, but that will only get you so far. To  make your AI reliable, it needs the same quality photos, videos, and recordings that are taken on your company\u2019s devices. It needs messy, accent-ridden speech from six feet away on your phone\u2019s mic with wind noise and a lawn mower in the background.Human training of AI isn\u2019t some rare event, it\u2019s common practice. Tesla\u2019s self-driving capacities are being built with human beings training a neural network by looking at the camera data from its customers\u2019 cars and marking signs, lanes, other cars, bikes, pedestrians, and so on. You just can\u2019t train a high-quality machine learning algorithm without humans reviewing the data.Because it\u2019s simply not possible to train a high-quality AI algorithm meant to be used by millions of people without human review, most companies at least attempt to make it semi-anonymous. Before any human hears a recording, it is stripped of any data that could be used to identify a precise user. At least, that\u2019s what the companies tell us they do.But a certain amount of data beyond the actual voice recording or photo/video is usually needed, so it can\u2019t be  anonymous.For example, if I say, \u201cHey Siri, what time does the UPS Store on Greenback Lane close?\u201d and Siri  I said \u201cWhat time does the UPS Store on Glenn Brook Lane close?\u201d I\u2019m going to get a bad result. There is no Glenn Brook Lane near me, and certainly no UPS Store there. But there\u2019s no way for an automated system to know that its transcription was wrong, because that\u2019s certainly a thing a person  say.So a human being has to review these things, and they need to know roughly where I was when I made the request. These human \u201cgraders\u201d aren\u2019t going to know that Glenn Brook Lane is wrong without enough location data to know that there\u2019s no Glenn Brook Lane near me, right?Similarly, a person reviewing Ring video footage to differentiate moving cars versus peoplevmay need to know if they\u2019re looking at footage from an outdoor camera (which sees lots of cars) or an indoor camera (which should only see cars through windows).It\u2019s hard to know exactly how consumers would react to the way their data can be used to train AI algorithms if they knew exactly how it works and exactly what was being done to protect their privacy. I have a feeling that most would be okay with it (if people were all that concerned about personal info and privacy, Facebook wouldn\u2019t be used by 1.2 billion people).But they don\u2019t know, and none of the companies involved seem interested in explaining it. Short statements to the tech press are not the same thing as informing your hundreds of millions of users. Hiding permissive statements 4,000 words deep into your dense Terms of Service agreement doesn\u2019t count. This lack of disclosure is a key failure.One of the biggest problems is the fact that virtual assistants often record things they\u2019re not supposed to. Siri, Alexa, and the Google Assistant are basically always recording. They listen to a few seconds at a time in a constantly looping on-device buffer, sending no information anywhere until they hear the wake-up phrase: Hey Siri, Alexa, or OK Google / Hey Google. Only after that do they activate the network connection and send your data to the cloud.As we all know, sometimes these wake phrases don\u2019t work, and sometimes they are triggered even when nobody said them. Those false triggers are what end up causing the human \u201cgraders\u201d to hear to snippets of private conversations, drug deals, sexual activity, and so on.Again, there\u2019s no simple solution. These assistants aren\u2019t going to get perfect at hearing their wake-up phrases unless human beings actually tell them when they got it wrong.That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that we have to pass our data along to others. We could do the training and grading ourselves. Apple could change the iPhone so that every single time Siri is summoned, we are presented with simple \u201ccorrect\u201d or \u201cincorrect\u201d buttons. If the user marks one incorrect, perhaps they could offer more info\u2014the correct phrase, or the way that the answer they were given was not what was expected.Smart speakers could be given keyphrases that allow us to do the same thing with our voice, perhaps using a linked phone to make corrections.Then the adjusted algorithm\u2014but none of our personal data\u2014could be sent back to the parent company to be combined with everyone else\u2019s and incorporated into the next software release. Some companies already use this method for certain kinds of ML algorithms, like smart predictive text in keyboards (where, by its very nature, we all correct mistakes).The vast majority of users would never bother to grade and correct their virtual assistant, of course. The whole point of them is to avoid this tedium, and who wants to review every mis-diagnosed movement trigger on their smart security camera or mis-labeled photo in an AI-powered photo album? That\u2019s . That\u2019s the opposite of what AI is for.But with a big enough audience, and Apple can certainly lay claim to that with over a billion devices in use, even a tiny fractional percent of active users training their devices would be a huge sample to draw from. It might even be enough to make Siri an  AI assistant, which it currently definitely is not.Would a company like Apple be willing to go that extra mile? To tarnish its slick design and \u201cit just works\u201d appearances with an easily accessible interface that, by its very existence, implies something doesn\u2019t work often enough? Probably not. Apple will likely quickly complete its review of its grading program and re-instate it with a toggle switch in the privacy settings to opt out. It\u2019s the simple thing to do, but it\u2019s a missed opportunity to turn at least a small portion of hundreds of millions of Siri users into active Siri improvers.This story, \"So Apple\u2019s going to stop listening in on your Siri requests.
